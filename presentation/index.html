<h1> Cross Site Scripting! (XSS) </h1>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>
Cross Site Scripting, more commonly known as XSS, is a type of web vulnerability that allows for the unintended execution of arbitrary javascript on a webpage. It occurs when user input is added to a webpage unsanitized, allowing users to inject html and javascript code, which the browser renders as if it came from the author of the page.

<h2>Finding XSS Vulns</h2>
<p>
To discover XSS vulnerabilities, test any field that accepts user input and attempt to insert special characters, such as script tags.
